# FoodApp
Food ‘n Stuff is an open source project from BIT Department of Lahti University of Applied Sciences aiming to create a website for creating shopping list according to the recipes, adding or removing foodstuff items and many different kinds of features.
This project is to design and implement a software which can help users to create shopping list and account food stuff. This software will support users to create new shopping list easier. To accomplish this software, we will build an efficient system and a user interface to users. The functionalities that this system is supposed to have are creating shopping list, adding and remove stuff in/from the storage accounting, having ability to add or update recipes and food stuff items, to output a report of costs for specified period.

My roles in this project are Project Manager and Back-end Developer. I take care that the project stays on schedule, build the foundation for the project and shares tasks in team. The leader’s task is also to lead team meetings and participate to the steering group meeting. As a back-end developer, I design the database, create important functionalities and features for the application.

Technologies: ASP.NET, Materializecss, Javascript

The project was deployed by Azure, but in the future I'll try to deploy it somewhere else since this Azure account is about to expire :(
